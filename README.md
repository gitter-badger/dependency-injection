# Simple Dependency Injection Experiment

This is my simple dependency injection experiment in PHP

Features:
```
  - can resolve class dependency that placed only on constructor.
```

Setter injection and method injection not yet implemented.
Feel free to look, or clone it for your own needs.

If you want to run unit tests:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you need more verbose:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose
```
